["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale flats is an important asset for Singapore. Factors such as the location, size, community facilities and presence of good amenities has influenced the price of HDB prices over time. A good sample of how HDB prices has changed over time can be obtained from DataGov resale price data, which are determine by demand and supply and the professional real estate valuer. HDB units is a high-value asset with a large proportion of income invested in a roof over our head. With more than 80% of Singapore population living in HDB flats, it is an essential jigsaw piece of good social stability. With high cost of owning a car in Singapore, the effect on staying near an MRT station will save time and money accumulated in travelling for school, work and play. A premium on a flat near is MRT is expected, and if the MRT is an interchange station the effect is stronger with two options of travelling and making accessibility to other areas less bearable. On this backdrop, the motivation of this report is to find out whether Downtown Line MRT station near HDB flats will have a price premium or other behaviours. This is done through regression and clustering techniques that are learnt for Computational Urban Analysis class. "],
["literature-review.html", "Chapter 3 Literature Review", " Chapter 3 Literature Review Studies done to find the effect on price with a new MRT on the Downtown Line from NUS Economics thesis. He looked at all stations on Downtown Line 2 and examine the resale price effect using regression. The key result is an average initial increase in nearby resale prices by 1.9 per cent, construction period by 3 per cent, and 7 per cent for those within 1km. A difference-in-difference approach is used to analyse the data (Chia and Lim 2016). References "],
["descriptive-statistics.html", "Chapter 4 Descriptive Statistics 4.1 Dataset 4.2 Exploring the Dataset", " Chapter 4 Descriptive Statistics 4.1 Dataset I have chosen four MRT stations to investigate namely Bukit Panjang, Tampines West, Tampines and Tampines East on the Downtown Line. The dataset is obtained by merging three of the tables found from Data@Gov. The filter was applied to obtain transactions located in districts of Bukit Panjang and Tampines. For Tampines, addresses in Simei are excluded as they are near to Simei MRT on the East West Line. This will reduce the number of transactions to analyse as the study focus on Tampines West (“TW”), Tampines (“T”) and Tampines East (“TE”). Stage/Period Pre-construction (period = 1) Construction (period = 2) Completion (period = 3) Stage 2 BP Jan 2009 to Jun 2011 Jul 2011 to Dec 2015 Jan 2016 to Dec 2018 Stage 3 TW, T, TE Jan 2009 to Oct 2011 Nov 2011 to Oct 2017 Nov 2017 to Dec 2018 Table 1: Breakdown of Periods The dataset of all resale transactions of the estates are categorised into three time periods, as DTL Stage 2 and Stage 3 have different timelines. The dates are based on Land Transport Authority press release which is a good proxy to separate into three unique categories. Parameter period is used to differentiate the three periods. Distance to the MRT station is determine using the R package, sp to find st_distances. Co-ordinates are obtained using BatchGeo. To ascertain whether the property is near to MRT, the distance to MRT is calculated and less than 1km is near. Near to mrt will have the dummy variable connected = 1, otherwise 0. The distance to nearest MRT in km is also included in the regression model. For Tampines, the nearest MRT station is chosen from the housing block. Distance to town centre to Bukit Panjang Interchange and Tampines Interchange respectively. Near popular primary school variable accounts for the effect of St. Hilda Primary School in Tampines, as the balloting process for places is competitive and indicated in websites. Near_popular_sch is assigned 1 for within 1km from the school, otherwise 0. There is no popular school in Bukit Panjang. For park, HDB property that is located just right beside a park will have assigned 1 otherwise 0. This accounts for the effect of greenery on the resale price. For storey, it is created by taking the mid-point of the storey range. For example, 07 to 09 will be 8 and 11 to 15 is 13. The older dataset is in intervals of 5 floors. Lease remaining is calculated The parameters used are described as below. Variable Descriptor Cat.

With three MRT stations are taken into consideration, HDBs are nearer to MRt and hence a lower mean distance to MRT. Hence, 0.4 to 0.8km range to MRT for Tampines is more common than 1 to 1.2km for BP. boxplot(data_bp$floor_area_sqm,data_tamp$floor_area_sqm, main=&quot;Floor Square Area&quot;, xlab=&quot;Town&quot;, ylab=&quot;Floor Square Area&quot;, names=c(&quot;BP&quot;, &quot;T&quot;)) Figure 4.3: Floor Square Area Considering by each period, the mean resale price has increased and then decreased for BP but it has increased throughout in Tampines. BP is a non-matured town with more Built to Order flats coming up to ramp up the supply, then it has seen a lower average price. Also, the resale market also accounts for the other factors such as proximity to Central Business District and attractiveness of the town. ggplot(data=data_bp, aes(x=flat_type)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;count&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;BP by Flat Type&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 4.4: BP by Flat Type ggplot(data=data_tamp, aes(x=flat_type)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;count&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;T by Flat Type&quot;) + theme_bw() Figure 4.5: T by Flat Type By flat type, majority of the flats are 4-room 3530 units for BP and 5331 Tampines.

This will provide two ways of looking at the data, RC2 and RC3 as well as RC1 and RC2. fa &lt;- tamp_block_p1 %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var = &quot;short_street_name&quot;) %&gt;% select(-period) %&gt;% principal(nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) %&gt;% pluck(&#39;scores&#39;) %&gt;% unclass() %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &quot;short_street_name&quot;) fa %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = RC2, y = RC3)) + geom_text(aes(label = short_street_name)) Figure 6.4: Factor Analysis Period 1 set.seed(1234) cluster_data &lt;- fa %&gt;% # remove planning_area column so we are left with only &#39;data&#39; columns column_to_rownames(var = &quot;short_street_name&quot;) kmeans_clusters &lt;- kmeans(cluster_data, centers = 4, nstart = 50) kmeans_clusters ## K-means clustering with 4 clusters of sizes 12, 3, 8, 4 ## ## Cluster means: ## RC1 RC3 RC2 RC4 ## 1 -0.4020473 -0.4447678 -0.6274196 -0.4702097 ## 2 0.4625298 1.2834533 1.1413307 -1.5865209 ## 3 0.7544959 0.6008555 -0.2033782 0.9231409 ## 4 -0.6497472 -0.8299978 1.4330172 0.7542379 ## ## Clustering vector: ## AVE 4 AVE 5 AVE 7 AVE 8 AVE 9 CTRL 1 ST 11 ST 12 ST 21 ## 1 3 3 2 3 1 4 1 1 ## ST 22 ST 23 ST 24 ST 32 ST 33 ST 34 ST 41 ST 42 ST 43 ## 4 1 1 3 3 3 1 1 3 ## ST 44 ST 45 ST 71 ST 72 ST 81 ST 82 ST 83 ST 84 ST 91 ## 1 3 2 2 1 1 4 4 1 ## ## Within cluster sum of squares by cluster: ## [1] 18.151954 1.960164 23.805472 1.824574 ## (between_SS / total_SS = 56.0 %) ## ## Available components: ## ## [1] &quot;cluster&quot; &quot;centers&quot; &quot;totss&quot; &quot;withinss&quot; ## [5] &quot;tot.withinss&quot; &quot;betweenss&quot; &quot;size&quot; &quot;iter&quot; ## [9] &quot;ifault&quot; fviz_cluster(kmeans_clusters, data = cluster_data, main = &quot;Tampines Period 1&quot;) Figure 6.5: K Means Plot Period 1 fviz_nbclust(cluster_data, kmeans, method = &quot;wss&quot;) Figure 6.6: Optimal Number of Clusters A note on determining the number of clusters by identifying the shoulder from the chart and 4 is a decent number to work with. fa2 &lt;- tamp_block_p2 %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var = &quot;short_street_name&quot;) %&gt;% select(-period) %&gt;% principal(nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) %&gt;% pluck(&#39;scores&#39;) %&gt;% unclass() %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &quot;short_street_name&quot;) fa2 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = RC2, y = RC3)) + geom_text(aes(label = short_street_name)) Figure 6.7: Factor Analysis Period 2 fviz_cluster(kmeans_clusters2, data = cluster_data2, main = &quot;Tampines Period 2&quot;) Figure 6.8: K Means Period 2 fa3 &lt;- tamp_block_p3 %&gt;% column_to_rownames(var = &quot;short_street_name&quot;) %&gt;% select(-period) %&gt;% principal(nfactors = 4, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) %&gt;% pluck(&#39;scores&#39;) %&gt;% unclass() %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &quot;short_street_name&quot;) fa3 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = RC2, y = RC3)) + geom_text(aes(label = short_street_name)) Figure 6.9: Factor Analysis Period 3 ## K-means clustering with 4 clusters of sizes 8, 1, 13, 6 ## ## Cluster means: ## RC4 RC3 RC2 RC1 ## 1 0.7405699 0.9106619 -0.07880494 -0.65241104 ## 2 -1.6859694 2.5136703 -0.34803984 3.46312336 ## 3 -0.2034392 -0.6445917 -0.59886215 0.18052291 ## 4 -0.2656466 -0.2365454 1.46061455 -0.09843881 ## ## Clustering vector: ## AVE 4 AVE 5 AVE 7 AVE 8 AVE 9 CTRL 1 CTRL 7 ST 11 ST 12 ## 3 3 1 4 1 3 2 4 3 ## ST 21 ST 22 ST 23 ST 24 ST 32 ST 33 ST 34 ST 41 ST 42 ## 3 4 3 3 1 1 1 3 3 ## ST 43 ST 44 ST 45 ST 71 ST 72 ST 81 ST 82 ST 83 ST 84 ## 1 3 1 1 4 3 3 4 4 ## ST 91 ## 3 ## ## Within cluster sum of squares by cluster: ## [1] 17.687999 0.000000 22.978607 6.938138 ## (between_SS / total_SS = 55.9 %) ## ## Available components: ## ## [1] &quot;cluster&quot; &quot;centers&quot; &quot;totss&quot; &quot;withinss&quot; ## [5] &quot;tot.withinss&quot; &quot;betweenss&quot; &quot;size&quot; &quot;iter&quot; ## [9] &quot;ifault&quot; fviz_cluster(kmeans_clusters3, data = cluster_data3, main = &quot;Tampines Period 3&quot;) Figure 6.10: K Means Period 3 For RC2 and RC3, a street that has a major change in relative positions is Ave 9. Ave 9 was similar to St 32 in period 1 and 2 and then moved to near to Ctrl 7. St 83 and St 22 moved closer. There is a change in scales with Ctrl 7 from Period 2. Based on RC2 and RC3, the positions are clustered and remain similar despite the completion of the new MRT stations. This shows some stability and that distance to MRT and lease remaining has little impact. This is supported by the small coefficients in the log-linear regression model. In k means clustering, the outlier Ctrl 7 has skewed the data and thus period 2 and period 3 cluster plot has shifted mostly to a corner of the graph away from the other points. Ctrl 7 has Design Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats which is in-between a executive condominium and regular HDB flats, translating to higher resale price. The average lease remaining for DBSS is high at 90 years and floor area is 108 square metres, which also deviate from Tampines average. By observing the movements across the clusters as adjusted with the best fit of cluster numbers since the clusters are arbituary across time periods, there are 16 streets that cluster remains unchanged, while the rest of the 12 changed. To compare 3 clusters easily across 3 periods, k means with 3 clusters is performed. kmeans_clusters1 &lt;- kmeans(cluster_data, centers = 3, nstart = 50) kmeans_clusters1 ## K-means clustering with 3 clusters of sizes 9, 7, 11 ## ## Cluster means: ## RC1 RC3 RC2 RC4 ## 1 -0.2192364 0.1524827 0.7200150 0.9307781 ## 2 1.1166228 0.1141529 0.4380098 -0.8788598 ## 3 -0.5312029 -0.1974013 -0.8678367 -0.2022713 ## ## Clustering vector: ## AVE 4 AVE 5 AVE 7 AVE 8 AVE 9 CTRL 1 ST 11 ST 12 ST 21 ## 3 2 3 2 1 3 1 2 3 ## ST 22 ST 23 ST 24 ST 32 ST 33 ST 34 ST 41 ST 42 ST 43 ## 1 3 3 2 1 1 3 3 1 ## ST 44 ST 45 ST 71 ST 72 ST 81 ST 82 ST 83 ST 84 ST 91 ## 3 1 2 2 3 2 1 1 3 ## ## Within cluster sum of squares by cluster: ## [1] 19.57024 28.51670 14.97225 ## (between_SS / total_SS = 39.4 %) ## ## Available components: ## ## [1] &quot;cluster&quot; &quot;centers&quot; &quot;totss&quot; &quot;withinss&quot; ## [5] &quot;tot.withinss&quot; &quot;betweenss&quot; &quot;size&quot; &quot;iter&quot; ## [9] &quot;ifault&quot; fviz_cluster(kmeans_clusters1, data = cluster_data, main = &quot;Tampines Period 1 with 3 centers&quot;) Figure 6.11: K Means Plot Period 1 with 3 centers With Ctrl 7 fixed at cluster 4 according to the table, the clusters that did not change will be the reference points for comparison. Ave 5 and St 12 was similar to St 32 but changed in period 3 to the majority because larger flats were sold for St 12 in period 3 and Ave 5 has the new Tampines Hub that may impacted the flat price. Ave 5 is en-circling from Industrial Ave 3 to Simei, hence the effect is not easily found on geographic space. Ave 7 moved from being like the majority to St 32 in period 3 is likely the opening of Tampines East as the eastern part of St 32 lies the MRT station. Also, St 32 and Ave 7 are geographically close. Ave 8 and St 72 in period 2 becomes similar to St 11, St 22, St 83 and St 84 where they are further from the MRT station and near Angsana Primary School or Junyuan Secondary School. AVe 8 is near Springfield Secondary and St 72 is near Poi Ching exhibit similar characteristics of near a school that might explains the similarity. These streets are slightly far from the MRT station too. AVE9, ST33, ST34, ST43, ST45 are located at the northern part of Tampines which could be geographically similar and hence cluster groups are the same for 3 periods. A change in period 3 could be Tampines East MRT effect which is perpendicular to St 32 - period 3 reference point. There are some new findings from clustering that can be attributed by the 4 factors or other factors not considered in this study. Clustering is a useful tool to do other forms of research and uncover differen angles. "],
["discussion.html", "Chapter 7 Discussion 7.1 Strengths 7.2 Weaknesses 7.3 Possible Further Studies", " Chapter 7 Discussion 7.1 Strengths The high R-square values and residuals which are quite normalised presents a good case of how HDB resale flat prices can be modelled. For cluster analysis, it opens up the opportunity to examine street level trends using the chosen numerical summaries. 7.2 Weaknesses For regression, parks and primary schools did not have a significant effect on price, that was not as what I have expected. It could have other variables or reasons to better estimate the coefficients. The study consider 1km as the cut-off distance, which can be amended to 0.5, 1 and 1.5km for analysis. For clustering, the choice of street level may not be a good perspective. 7.3 Possible Further Studies The study focus on local level price dynamics of HDB prices by choosing an estate in the East and Northwest of Singapore. Tampines as one of the five other emerging hubs (Woodlands, Changi, Jurong Lake, Punggol Digital) to decentralise Singapore is a good motivation to study the trend. An extended study can be done to explore the all the stations on the Downtown Line. This could be compared to other opening of MRT is the recent decades such as the Circle Line. Thomson-East Coast Line could have similar trajectory based on the variables provided by DataGov. Bukit Panjang has an LRT station connected from Choa Chu Kang to Bukit Panjang which was not considered in this study. The bus system acts compliments the MRT in other estates which hig frequency that may not be an important. A comparsion with Punggol and Sengkang would be appropriate since they have an existing LRT line. Private properties are not considered and the impact of new MRT station affects the real estate values for speculative and investment returns. K Means on Bukit Panjang can be done to find patterns. Also, other variables can be included and then dimensional reduction can be done to sieve out the critical variables that affect resale prices with the highest impact. "],
["summary.html", "Chapter 8 Summary", " Chapter 8 Summary The project has answered how HDB prices are affected by the opening of a new MRT station, and the distance to MRT station from the housing unit is significant. K means clustering has some promising results to examine the factors that affect the street level. "],
